The purpose of e-commerce dashboards is to provide a quick summary of a company’s bottom line at a glance. 
Along with reports, dashboards are one of the most useful business intelligence and analytics techniques to support executives’ and managers’ decision-making.

The contents of an e-commerce dashboard may include graphs, charts, tables, maps, gauges, and other data visualization methods that help users rapidly understand the underlying data.
E-commerce dashboards may be designed for general use across the organization or for a specific use case. For example, individual teams may design custom dashboards to monitor their marketing performance or sales performance.
